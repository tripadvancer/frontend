Once your location is detected, the **"Find a random place"** button will become active. Now you can specify the search radius (in kilometers) from your location and select categories in the "categories" section, then simply click the **"Find a random place"** button.

If there are any interesting places nearby, you will see a randomly selected place that matches your criteria. If no place is found, try adjusting the categories or increasing the search radius.
